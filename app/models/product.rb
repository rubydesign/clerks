# RubyClerk product may represent one of three things
# - the normal product (all attributes work as expected)
# - a product line, in which case it may not be sold and inventory is the sum of the items
#                   other attributes (like price/cost) act as a template and are copied into children
#                   where they are then used.
# - an (line) item of a product line, in which case the default view concatenates name and description and
#                   shows prices relative to it's parent
#
# This makes the model a three headed one and validation is a little more complicated
# - a product line _may not_ have an ean (as it can't be sold)
# - a product and product line _must_ have a link , but  (those are generated if needed)
# - line item _may not_ have a link (this is enforced, not validated)

# attributes : see permitted_attributes + inventory + deleted_on
