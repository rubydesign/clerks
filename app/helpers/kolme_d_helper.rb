    "  This is a basic cylinder geometry, copied fromm threejs.
      One can get surprisingly far by using the sliders.

    "Twist is achieved with the bottom (twist) control. Results are best for
    quite low segment values, so the triangles show better.

    "
      The extra radii (25,50,75) pull the shape into that direction. Only the 0
      and 100, ie top and bottom, are exact. Lots of fun to be had here.
